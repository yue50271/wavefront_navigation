This is matlab code for unpublished conference paper titled "Goal-Directed Navigation In Multi-Scale Environment Based On Wavefronts Propagation In Cortical Network" which invlolves a biomimic goal-directed navigation method.
The code consists of three parts that need to be implemented sequentially:
Creating_cortical_columns:  The robot explores unknown environment and creates cortical columns.
Wavefront_propagation: Propagate back reward among cortical network for establishing moving direction field.
Navigation: Navigate according to the direction vector field.
